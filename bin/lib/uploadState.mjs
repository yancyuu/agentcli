// uploadState.mjs — pure helpers for the 消息上报 (conversation upload) toggle.
// Extracted from hermit.mjs so the two decisions that drive the menu display
// are unit-testable and reused (not triplicated) across the status row and the
// two badge call sites (toggle-message-upload + data-sync/local-collection).
//
// These are pure functions: no side effects, no I/O, no hermit.mjs imports.

/**
 * Reconcile a persisted telemetry object into the single canonical boolean that
 * means "conversation upload is on". This MUST agree with the worker gate
 * (UsageTelemetryService / ConversationMessageUploadService), which ORs
 * `conversationUploadEnabled || conversations.uploadEnabled`. The top-level
 * `uploadEnabled` is a legacy dead field — written by old code paths but never
 * read for upload behavior — so it is deliberately ignored here; honoring it
 * would make the CLI claim "enabled" while the worker refuses to upload.
 *
 * @param {unknown} telemetry
 * @returns {boolean}

 * read as "on and working" even though nothing was uploading.
