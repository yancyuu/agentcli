/**
 * Parses a leading "@team subject" directive from a message body.
 *
 * Accepts both the ASCII '@' (U+0040) and the full-width '＠' (U+FF20) so a
 * mention typed under a CJK IME still routes cross-team. Without this, a
 * full-width '＠' fails the dispatch regex, the message falls through to a
 * local send, and the user's own team answers instead of the mentioned one.
 *
 * Only the trigger character is normalized here; case / slug resolution is left
 * to each caller (MessageComposer vs loopSendIntent), which already differ.
 *
 * `\s` already covers the full-width space (U+3000), so no special separator
 * handling is needed.
