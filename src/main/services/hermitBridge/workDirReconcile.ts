/**
 * hermit-bridge spawns each agent subprocess with `chdir(<project work_dir>)`. When a

 * every session fails at agent start with `chdir ...: no such file or directory`,
 * which hermit-bridge surfaces as "❌ 错误: 启动 Agent 会话失败". The session record is
 * created fine, so the user sees the success message AND the failure.
 *
 * This hit the Helm Loop hardest: its bind project is `my-project`, the same name
 * hermit-bridge ships as an unconfigured template (`work_dir = /path/to/your/project`).
